So what an active couple of months it's been! I've been working solidly to finish my degree (main part of which is myÂ dissertation) and I'mÂ finallyÂ nearly there. I handed in my write up yesterday and only have a few exams and one piece of coursework left. Scary times ahead, but I have plenty of projects to keep me busy.

The first of which is my first iOS App! This has been very exciting and is very close to completion. I'm not going to give anything away right now but WATCH THIS SPACE! I'llÂ announceÂ it here when it's ready. ðŸ˜„

Now I've finished all the big stuff for my degree as well I can now start some projects that I've been planning for a little while. The main of these being the completion of my web site and the creation of a couple more. I've got a lot of ideas going at the moment and am very excited about things.

The main story is there is going to be a lot of things being updated over the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned. It's going to be exciting! ðŸ˜„
