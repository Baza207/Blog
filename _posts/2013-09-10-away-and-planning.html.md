So I'm currently looking over the amazingly blue sea off of Crete in the last few days of my honeymoon, and starting to think about all the things I have waiting for me when I get back. Don't get me wrong, I've got a lot of plans and exciting ones at that, but relaxing here in the sun after going full pace for so long has been very nice.

I plan to make this a short post (haha, short), just to say what I'm going to be looking into from now until Christmas and beyond. A basic outline if you will.

<!-- READMORE -->

I managed to get Puck 2.0 out before I left and in time for the Elitserien league starting up again on Sept 14th. I'm going to write a more in depth post later about the new features and my plans for it but I just wanted to say that more leagues will be coming, and soon! I redesigned the backend of Puck so that I can add leagues on my server at will and not have to go though the Apple review process every time. This should hopefully speed up the addition of leagues in the future as I know people want more, ASAP.

Obviously, later this evening we've got the Apple keynote about what we all can only assume will be the new iPhone(s) and a release date for iOS 7. With the release of iOS 7 I will have a lot of new toys to play with and so I am planning a refresh of all of my apps, as soon as I have time. <em>rubs hands with glee</em>

Dog Bins has update plans in the pipeline to do a major performance upgrade. I am we'll aware that when I started it, I was just learning geo and map technology in iOS. Now, I have a much better understanding of it all and so feel a lot more equipped to make it much better, and faster!

Pixel Pals 2.0 has been on the back burner for a little while. I had some problems with getting the maths to work correctly in the backend and was driving myself a little around the bend trying to work it out. Sometimes you just need to stop, step back and look at something else for a while, as so to clear your head. I'm looking forward to working on it again and getting 2.0 back into full flow again.

Lastly we have Colour Cubes. This app was a bit of fun to play around with several game engines that are commonly used for iOS. With that in mind, I think it's only fitting to use it to test out the new game engine Apple has produced for iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, SpriteKit. It looks like it has an awful lot of fun and powerful features that I can't wait to play with.

All in all I can't wait to get started with all my plans. I do of course have the usual obligations of what you could call "real work", and that will always take precedence. But with what iOS 7 promises and what I've got rattling around my brain, all I can say is, bring it on!
