Puck 3.0 is finally here!

It’s taken a while now of me messing around and technologies I was going to use changing, but I finally managed to finish and release Puck 3.0 for the SHL 2016/2017 season.

So, what’s new? Well I did a major redesign of the app around a year ago. It brings Puck more inline with how iOS looks generally these days. A little bit cleaner and more direct to get the content to you. Secondly, there’s now video highlights in the app! You can now view video highlights for games, right from the app, or you can stream these to your AppleTV.

There’s also been a few other little changes, like being able to see the SHL arena website for a game that is currently live or has been played, allowing you to see play by plays right from the app. There is also now an app for you AppleWatch owners out there that allows you to see live games, standings and news summaries.

All in all I’m very pleased with this new update and looking forward for people to get hold of it.

Puck 3.0 is a free update to all existing users, and can be downloaded here:

I’ve got some ideas for extra features going forward, but if you have any suggestions, please let me know at [james@pigonahill.com](mailto:james@pigonahill.com?subject=Puck 3).
