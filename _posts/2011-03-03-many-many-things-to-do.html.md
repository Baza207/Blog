Well got to start this blog somewhere IÂ suppose. First thing to say is that the spelling in all of this will beÂ awfulÂ because I'mÂ dyslexicÂ and probably will be writing these fast, off the top of my head type of stuff. ðŸ˜„

I've spent the most of the day working on my first app. I'm doing this for myÂ dissertationÂ and its due in four weeks. I've got so much to do it's unreal. The basic navigation is all down and working but the app is no way near fully functioning. Cocoa just doesn't seem to have libraries capable of using a lot of graphics with sprites. I know there are add-ons such as Cocos2D but I have no way in the amount of time needed to learn those atm. Of course there's the added pressure that I have normal lectures and work for them to do as well. Would be nice if I felt challenged by what I was doing in these lectures, but I'm just board.

I'm not saying all the Uni stuff I've done has been easy, a lot has taken time, but that's it. It's takes time, it's not really mind taxing. The most taxing thing I've done over these last three years has been this App, and that's all from my own choosing. Of course the thing I put the most effort into as well, looks like the one thing I might not get in on time, but hey, that's life. It's not like I'm going to stop trying. I will work around the clock to get it in on time. ðŸ˜„

I just had a break from it actually to draw out a splash video storyboard for Pig on a Hill. Should be pretty good. I don't know how I'm going to make it. Might end up making it in Flash and then exporting it as a video format, but we'll see. I'm going to put it at theÂ beginningÂ of my website, and also at theÂ beginningÂ of all of my apps I think. Ideas for it are cool, but got to get some sounds for it as well. Show of visual and audio aspects.

Anyway, back to work now. Probably will postÂ anotherÂ blog later tonight. I feel like it's going to be a late one.

James
